## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

 * revised the Author fields to note other sources of code and 
   copyright holders to that code.
 * fixed documentation of internal, non-exported functions so that
   no un-runnable examples exist.
 * added arXiv link for the methods implemented in the package.

This should address the comments on the previous submission.

## Test environments (this resubmission)
* local Fedora 30, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), rel, devel, oldrel
* winbuilder (release and devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 notes

The installations had notes about this:

* This is a new release.

Otherwise, clear.
