## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

 * amended the \concept{} fields in the documentation. 

To answer the question about a DOI for the methods, a paper is being 
submitted in the near future and a reference and DOI can be added to the 
DESCRIPTION when available.


## Test environments (this resubmission)
* local Fedora 30, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0, devel, oldrel
* winbuilder (devel)


## R CMD check results
