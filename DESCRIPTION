Description: Provides sampling and density functions for matrix
    variate normal, t, and inverted t distributions;  ML fitting for matrix
    variate normal and t distributions including some restrictions on the
    parameters; and classification by linear and quadratic discriminant
    analysis for matrix variate normal and t distributions. Performs clustering
    of matrix variate normal and t distributions by mixture modeling.
