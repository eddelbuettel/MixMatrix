# matrixdist 0.0.0.9922
 
* Added LDA and QDA functions with predict() methods. These functions
  are relatively fragile.
* Marked some functions as internal to clean up the NAMESPACE

# matrixdist 0.0.0.9921

* Added support for using IID structure for covariance matrices
* correction on restricted means - only true if known variance

# matrixdist 0.0.0.9920

* added change to mean estimation to account for restricted means
* added changes to documentation


# matrixdist 0.0.0.9919

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Changed the name of the maximum likelihood parameter fitting function to MLmatrixnorm since mle.--- could be confused for a method.
